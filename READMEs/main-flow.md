# Main flow

This step is the fun one! In it, you'll create agents, then run them.

We assume you've already
- (a) [installed pdr-backend](install.md),
- (b) [done local setup](setup-local.md) or [remote setup](setup-remote.md)
- (c) [deployed DT3](deploy-dt3.md)

Steps in this flow:
1. Create agents: trueval, predictoor, trader, ..
2. Run loop with agents interacting

Let's go!

## 1. Create agents

In the same Python console:
```python
foo bar
```


## 2. Run loop with agents interacting

In the same Python console:
```python
foo bar
```
