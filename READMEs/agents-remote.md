# Run agents, Remotely

In this step, you run and create agents that live on Azure (Web2 cloud)

**NOTE: THIS IS NOT COMPLETE!!** It will need heavy revisions. But before that, we want everything smooth on {local chain, local agents} and {remote chain, local agents}.

We assume you've already
- (a) [installed pdr-backend](install.md)
- (b) [done local setup](setup-local.md) or [remote setup](setup-remote.md)
- (c) [deployed DT3](deploy-dt3.md)

Steps in this flow:
1. Create agents: trueval, predictoor, trader, ..
2. Run loop with agents interacting

Let's go!

## 1. Create agents

In the same Python console:
```python
foo bar
```


## 2. Run loop with agents interacting

In the same Python console:
```python
foo bar
```
